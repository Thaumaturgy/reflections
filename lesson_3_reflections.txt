When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is especially helpful when working in a team. It also allows me to work on different machines. Work done locally is eventually pushed to remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This lessens confusion when working in a team. Pulling changes from team members will make parts of a piece of code foreign. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - used when cloning repos in GitHub unto the user's GitHub account
Clones - clones repos from the server to local machine. Git remote is setup automatically.
Branches - totally irrelevant to the first two. Used when developing risky or experimental features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This is so we do not need a constant connection to the service hosting our online repo. We will be able to work with the remote repo (sort of) even when offline. For example, it is useful when I am about to board a plane.
