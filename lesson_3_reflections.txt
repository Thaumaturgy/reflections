When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is especially helpful when working in a team. It also allows me to work on different machines. Work done locally is eventually pushed to remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This lessens confusion when working in a team. Pulling changes from team members will make parts of a piece of code foreign.
